# App Name: My Weight Loss

The "My Weight Loss" app is designed to help you track your weight loss progress and achieve your desired weight goal. It provides incremental steps and features to support your weight loss journey. Here's what the app offers:

-   Goal Setting: Start by setting your target weight. Specify the amount of weight you want to lose, and the app will guide you towards achieving that goal.

-   Calorie Tracking: The app calculates the target calorie intake for each week/day based on your weight loss goals. It also helps you monitor your food intake by analyzing your daily calorie consumption.

-   Exercise Tracking: Keep track of your exercise and physical activity to ensure you're burning calories effectively. The app estimates the calories expended during exercises and helps you maintain a healthy exercise routine.

-   Weight Session: Log your weight periodically to monitor your progress accurately. The app allows you to record your weight at least once a week, providing you with valuable data to track your success.

-   Analysis and Visualization: Gain insights into your weight loss journey through daily intake analysis and an overall weight graph. The app provides estimations and tracks Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total Healthy Index and current weight loss per week.

-   Target Adjustment: If needed, you can modify your weight loss target at any time within the app. This flexibility ensures that the app aligns with your changing goals and requirements.

-   Milestones and Rewards: Throughout your weight loss journey, the app sets three main milestones. When you reach each milestone and maintain the weight for one week, you'll receive a self-chosen gift as a reward.

The "My Weight Loss" app empowers you to track your progress, stay motivated, and make informed decisions to achieve your weight loss goals effectively.
